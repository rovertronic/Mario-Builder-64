// COMMON HACK CHANGES
// Internal ROM name. NEEDS TO BE **EXACTLY** 20 CHARACTERS. Can't be 19 characters, can't be 21 characters. You can fill it with spaces.
// The end quote should be here:               "
#define INTERNAL_ROM_NAME "SUPERMARIO64        "
// Disable lives and hide the lives counter
#define DISABLE_LIVES
// Skip peach letter cutscene
#define PEACH_SKIP
// Fixes the castle music sometimes triggering after getting a dialog
#define CASTLE_MUSIC_FIX
// Remove course specific camera processing
#define CAMERA_FIX
// Change the movement speed when hanging from a ceiling
#define HANGING_SPEED 4.f
// Makes Mario face the direction of the analog stick directly while hanging from a ceiling, without doing "semicircles"
#define TIGHTER_HANGING_CONTROLS
// Disables fall damage
#define NO_FALL_DAMAGE
// Disables the scream that mario makes when falling off a great height (this is separate from actual fall damage)

// Number of coins to spawn the "100 coin" star. If you remove the define altogether, then there won't be a 100 coin star at all.
#define X_COIN_STAR 100
// Platform displacement 2 also known as momentum patch. Makes Mario keep the momemtum from moving platforms. Breaks treadmills.

// HACKER QOL 
// Enable widescreen (16:9) support
#define WIDE
// When this option is enabled, LODs will ONLY work on console.
// When this option is disabled, LODs will work regardless of whether console or emulator is used.
// Regardless of whether this setting is enabled or not, you can use gIsConsole to wrap your own code in a console check.
#define AUTO_LOD
// Increase the maximum pole length (it will treat bparam1 and bparam2 as a single value)
#define LONGER_POLES
// Disable AA (Recommended: it changes nothing on emulator, and it makes console run better)
#define DISABLE_AA
// Allows Mario to ledgegrab sloped floors
#define NO_FALSE_LEDGEGRABS
// Number of possible unique model ID's (keep it higher than 256)
#define MODEL_ID_COUNT 256
// Increase audio heap size to allow for more concurrent notes to be played and for more custom sequences/banks to be imported (does nothing with EU and SH versions)
#define EXPAND_AUDIO_HEAP

// BUG/GAME QOL FIXES
// Fix instant warp offset not working when warping across different areas
#define INSTANT_WARP_OFFSET_FIX
// Whether a tree uses snow particles or not is decided via the model IDs instead of the course number

// Decides the warp node "exit course" takes you to (has no effect if you disable exit course)
#define EXIT_COURSE_NODE 0x1F

// OTHER ENHANCEMENTS
// Skybox size modifier, changing this will add support for larger skybox images. NOTE: Vanilla skyboxes may break if you change this option. Be sure to rescale them accordingly.
// Whenever you change this, make sure to run "make -C tools clean" to rebuild the skybox tool (alternatively go into skyconv.c and change the file in any way (like adding/deleting a space) to specifically rebuild that tool).
// When increasing this, you should probably also increase the GFX pool size. (the GFX_POOL_SIZE define in src/game/game_init.h)
#define SKYBOX_SIZE 1

// If you want to change the extended boundaries mode, go to engine/extended_bounds.h and change EXTENDED_BOUNDS_MODE
