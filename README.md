## FAQ

Q: Why in the hell are you bundling your own build of ``ld``?

A: Newer binutils (Like the one bundled with Ubuntu, 2.34) break linking with libultra builds due to local asm symbols.

This puts me at a crossroads of either touching leaked code and requiring GCC, or just using an older linker that works just fine.

I went with the latter.

Thanks to "someone2639" for this hacky-ass idea

Q: Will this allow me to use FlashRAM/Transfer Pak/microcode swapping/Other Cool N64 Features?

A: Theoretically, all yes.
