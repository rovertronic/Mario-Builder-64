    Better Extended Bounds by anonymous_moose
        Thanks to someone2639 for the shiftable segments patch
        Thanks to Wiseguy for the Surface Pool Full error code and 4x bounds fix

    0: Regular bounds
        Same as vanilla sm64, boundaries are (-8192 to 8191)
        16x16 collision cells.
    1: 2x extended bounds
        level boundaries are twice as big (-16384 to 16383)
        Collision calculations remain as fast as vanilla, at the cost of using more RAM.
        32x32 collision cells.
    2: Regular bounds (performance)
        Same boundaries as vanilla (-8192 to 8191), but with twice the amount of collision cells
        Trades more RAM usage for faster collision calculations.
        32x32 collision cells.
    3: 4x extended bounds
        level boundaries are 4 times as big (-32768 to 32767)
        Collision calculations remain as fast as vanilla, at the cost of using far more RAM (16 times vanilla).
        64x64 collision cells.


    If you see "SURFACE POOL FULL" or "SURFACE NODE POOL FULL" in game, you should increase
    SURFACE_POOL_SIZE or SURFACE_NODE_POOL_SIZE, respectively, or reduce the amount of
    collision surfaces in your level.
